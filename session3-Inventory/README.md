WHAT IS THE INVENTORY FILE?

The Ansible inventory file defines the hosts and groups of hosts upon which commands, modules, and tasks in a playbook operate. The file can be in one of many formats depending on your Ansible environment and plugins. The default location for the inventory file is /etc/ansible/hosts. If necessary, you can also create project-specific inventory files in alternate locations.

NOTE: Ansible is agentles but it uses SSH connection. So in order you to connect to remote server you need to establish ssh connection between your remote servers.
